# Valfisk

[![Built with Nix](https://builtwithnix.org/badge.svg)](https://builtwithnix.org)

Valfisk is a next-generation general purpose Discord app, built with [Poise](https://github.com/serenity-rs/poise) and [Serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity). It can be installed by both servers and users, with differing sets of features for each.

[**Try it out!**](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1164562106713128990)

## Features

## Self hosting

Valfisk's [Docker image](https://github.com/ryanccn/valfisk/pkgs/container/valfisk) is available at `ghcr.io/ryanccn/valfisk:latest`; it supports both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. A Nix package, from which the Docker image is built from, is also available in the repository's Nix flake.

Valfisk reads its configuration from environment variables:

- `DISCORD_TOKEN` is the only required environment variable. The registered Discord application should have the "Guild Members" and "Message Content" privileged intents enabled.
- `REDIS_URL` is a URL to a Redis or Redis-compatible server; it is optional but highly recommended, since some features will not work well or at all without it.
- `ADMIN_GUILD_ID` is a guild in which commands to manage Valfisk itself will be registered. `OWNERS` is a comma-separated list of user IDs that are allowed to run these commands; by default it is inferred from the Discord application's metadata.
- `ERROR_LOGS_CHANNEL` is a channel where internal errors from Valfisk will be logged. `DM_LOGS_CHANNEL` is one where direct messages sent to Valfisk will be logged.
- `PAGESPEED_API_KEY`, `SAFE_BROWSING_API_KEY`, `TRANSLATION_API_KEY` are [Google Cloud API keys](https://cloud.google.com/api-keys/docs/overview) for accessing the APIs required for certain features. (They can be set to the same key.)
- `HOST` and `PORT` form the address that the API server listens to. It defaults to `0.0.0.0:8080`.
